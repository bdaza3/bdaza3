## Hello, I'm Brian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a CS undergraduate at the University of Illinois Chicago, and I'm currently working on developing my skills in front-end development and frameworks. 
I have a keen interest in designing and engineering web applications and mobile apps, as well as delving into some backend software engineering.
